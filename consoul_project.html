            <h2>Overview </h2>
            <p>
               A devastating statistic done in 2020 revealed the “Gen Z” generation have the highest levels of depression, anxiety, social anxiety, self harm, body dysmorphia and low self-esteem. In addition to this issue, studies have also shown that an overwhelming amount of people facing this problem cannot afford the care they need. This needs to be addressed. Through creating ConSoul, we will give  people who do not have the financial means to receive the help they need.
            </p>

            <h2>The Problem </h2>
            <p>
               There are plenty of mental health apps on the market today- unfortunately even the most "affordable" are out of a vast percentage of the population's budget. People can't afford the help they need, especially in a time like the pandemic- we need to be coming together.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>The Solution </h2>
            <p>
               Our users need a way to receive professional help in a way that is affordable, safe and accessible. We will know this to be true when we see growth in individuals receiving affordable mental healthcare online who could not otherwise be receiving help. This allows educated therapist's to meet their hourly quota while giving free counseling to those in need.

            <h2>The Proccess</h2>

            <h2>Understanding The Problem</h2>
            <p> One of the first steps in UX design is understanding the problem you face.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>Possible Problems</h2>
            <p> Cost. Receiving professional advice from a licensed therapist or counselor can be very expensive. Unfortunately not many people can afford the help they need.
               Privacy. Engaging in this type of vulnerable experience online can make people feel disconnected and exposed.
               Qualifications. Addressing issues like mental health is an extremely sensitive matter. If you are not trained professionally in dealing with this- you can easily trigger someone into a downward cycle.
               Accessibility. If you are a minor, you need the consent of a parent to sign off on you receiving professional help. Maybe you don’t have a parent around. What then?
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
            <p>In the state of California, a therapist needs to put in a minimum of 1,750 hours of voluntary counseling before you can become licensed. I think this could be a beautiful, mutually beneficial solution for the both parties involved. I would like to develop the option of people in need to receive free counseling from educated therapists trying to meet their quota before they become licensed.
               In order to protect sensitive information, participants would need to sign an NDA.
               This topic is something that needs be handled very seriously, not just anyone can enter this program claiming to be a “mental health provider”. There must be strict qualifications and documentation of their education before allowing counselors to speak to anyone.
               There are a minors whose parents refuse to allow them to get professional help, or are simply not around. I would like for there to be an option where an adult family member, teacher, or a close friend can sign off on consent papers for the individual looking to receive care.

            <p>I found many consistencies.
               The most prominent were the following.
               Wanting things to be flexible.
               Personal/"in person" seeming.
               Money was a fear or a minimally a concern.

            <h3>Usability test plan.</h3>
         </div>
         <div>
            <p>Determine if the basic and core functions are easy to understand and perform for the users
               Observe that the users understand what the application is about and the value it holds
               Determine if the users are able to easily and successfully navigate through the application
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>Methodology:</h2>
            <p>These tests will be conducted via Zoom. Prior to the test, I explained to the participants what to expect during the study. The participants were given 5 tasks to complete with the Figma prototype, and their feedback was recorded and collected.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>Participants & Schedule:</h2>
            <p>The study recruited 6 participants (3 freelancers &  employed) within my personal network. Participants were of all ages and from a mixture of demographics.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>Results:</h2>
            <p>Overall, the test ran smoothly. Participants completed all 5 tasks effectively, however- I had room for improvement.</p>
            <p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>Four out of the six participants went to “profile” thinking it was homepage.</li>
               <li>ALL participants were confused on where to find their therapist. </li>
               <li>Three out of 4 users wanted more emotions at the check-in</li>
               <li>Four out of six participants advocated for “notes to be changed to journaling, conveying it felt more personal and less "clinical".</li>
               <li>Half of the participants wanted more color and a little prettier UI.</li>
            </ul>
         </div>

            <h2>Takeaway:</h2>

         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>Make the “homepage” more like the profile</li>
               <li>Create the "Therapist" option to be more significant and notable to see.</li>
               <li>Add additional emotions.</li>
               <li>Implement more color.</li>
               <li>Make profile settings simple.</li>

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>ConSoul is a work in progress. There are aspects that I am proud of, and there are aspects that still need a lot of work.
               That is one of my favorite parts of being a UX designer. Learning. Progress. Growth.
               I have learned so much this past year as a UX designer and I am eager to continue to grow and take my designs to the next level.
               Thank you for taking the time to watch my journey! Hope you enjoyed. :) Oh- and let's work together!
